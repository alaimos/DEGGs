# DEGGs
### Differentially Expressed Gene-Gene pairs
The DEGGs package test for differential gene-gene correlations across different groups of samples in count data from high-throughput 
sequencing assays.  
Specific gene-gene interactions can be explored and gene-gene pair regression plots can be interactively shown.   
See the vignette for more details.
